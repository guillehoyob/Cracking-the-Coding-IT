The problem is that if the first egg drops at the 50th floor, then you'll need to start dropping the second egg starting from the 1st floor and going up. This could take, at worst, 50 drops (the 50th floor drop, the 1st floorodrop, the 2nd floor drop, and up through the 49th floor drop). Can you beat this? \n",

The worst case here will be 19 drops (10, 20, ... , 100, 91, 92, ... , 99). Can you beat that? Try not randomly guessing at different solutions. Rather, think deeper. How is the worst case defined? How does the number of drops of each egg factor into that?\n",
    "- #333: If we drop Egg 1 at fixed intervals (e.g., every 10 floors), then the worst case is the worst case for Egg 1 + the worst case for Egg 2. The problem with our earlier solutions is that as Egg 1 does more work, Egg 2 doesn't do any less work. Ideally, we'd like to balance this a bit. As Egg 1 does more work (has survived more drops), Egg 2 should have less work to do. What might this mean?\n",
    "- #357: Try dropping Egg 1 at bigger intervals at the beginning and then at smaller and smaller intervals. The idea is to keep the sum of Egg 1 and Egg 2's drops as constant as possible. For each additional drop that Egg 1 takes, Egg 2 takes one fewer drop. What is the right interval? \n",

If Egg 1 breaks on the second drop, then we want Egg 2 to do X - 2 drops. If Egg 1 breaks on the third drop, then we want Egg 2 to do X - 3 drops.
